My IoT 'Smart Blinds' Project

The key point here is the control (opening and closing) of the blinds made automatic and which depends on the intensity of the outside light. Also, can analyse the duration of opening and closing of blinds.In this project, I have built my own Home Automation Project for the safety of kids and pets at home when we are away from home. For this, I chose to automate the blinds operation based on the time of the day, temperature and intensity of light
